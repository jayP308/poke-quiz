## Description
This app is contains series of 5 question that will test out pokemon fans out there if they know their pokemon well. It includes a reset quiz button so user can reset the game anytime and not record any scores. Just to be more fun, i added a different type of pokemon sound in each click, when the game is over, and a battle sound while the user is taking the quiz. User will be able to save their score towards the end, as well as when the timer runs out. I taken the accountability to give a warning in the beginning about high volume. This app have different type of CSS styling depending if access through desktop or phone.
